## Design Explanation

### Why did you choose this class?

I chose this class because I really like discovering new artists and trying out new genres. It is a fun yet intricate way to explore and listen to different kinds of music, allowing me to further delve into the vast diversity of the music industry.

### Which property is the most important? Why?

The `genreName` property is the most important because it encapsulates the primary identity of the object. It primarily is an identifier that helps the system distinguish between different genre records and properly sort them in a music catalog database.

### Which method is the most useful? Why?

The `updateFamousSong(songInfo: string)` method is the most useful because musical trends and hits are continuously changing. Having a method with a parameter allows the system to easily keep up with new trends and update the representative top track whenever a fresh song takes over the charts.
